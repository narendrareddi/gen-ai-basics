## What are Vector Stores?

Vector Stores are systems designed to **store and retrieve data represented as numerical vectors** (embeddings) along with associated metadata. They are critical for applications requiring semantic search, such as recommendation systems or RAG pipelines.

### Key Characteristics
1. **Purpose**: Efficiently store, manage, and retrieve high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) for tasks like semantic search, similarity computation, and data retrieval.
2. **Components**:
   - **Embeddings**: Numerical representations of text or other data capturing semantic meaning.
   - **Metadata**: Additional information associated with vectors (e.g., document ID, source, or attributes).
   - **Storage Options**: In-memory (temporary, fast) or on-disk (persistent, scalable).
3. **Core Functionality**:
   - Store vectors and metadata.
   - Perform similarity searches (e.g., cosine similarity).
   - Support indexing for fast retrieval.
   - Enable CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### Why Vector Stores?
Vector Stores address challenges in applications requiring semantic understanding and similarity-based retrieval, which traditional relational databases (e.g., MySQL, Oracle) cannot handle efficiently.

#### Example Use Case: Movie Recommendation System
- **Scenario**: Building a movie catalog website (like IMDb) where users search for movies, and you want to add a recommendation system suggesting similar movies based on a user’s current selection (e.g., Spider-Man).
- **Traditional Approach (Keyword Matching)**:
  - Compare movies based on attributes like director, actors, genre, or release date.
  - **Example**: "My Name is Khan" and "Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna" may seem similar due to shared director (Karan Johar), lead actor (Shah Rukh Khan), and genre (drama), but their plots are very different.
  - **Limitations**:
    - Keyword matching fails to capture semantic similarity (e.g., plot or thematic similarity).
    - Misses similar movies with different metadata (e.g., "Taare Zameen Par" and "A Beautiful Mind" share thematic elements but have different directors, actors, and release dates).
- **Vector Store Solution**:
  - Convert movie plots into embeddings (numerical vectors) using a model (e.g., OpenAI Embeddings).
  - Store embeddings in a Vector Store.
  - Compute similarity (e.g., cosine similarity) between embeddings to recommend movies with similar plots.
  - **Advantages**:
    - Captures semantic meaning of plots, leading to better recommendations.
    - Scales efficiently for large datasets with indexing techniques.
  - **Challenges**:
    1. **Generating Embeddings**: Creating embeddings for large datasets (e.g., millions of movies).
    2. **Storage**: Storing embeddings and metadata efficiently, as relational databases are not optimized for vectors.
    3. **Semantic Search**: Performing fast similarity searches on high-dimensional vectors without computing pairwise similarities for all items.
  - **Vector Stores Solve These**:
    - Provide storage for embeddings and metadata.
    - Enable fast similarity searches using indexing.
    - Support scalable retrieval for large datasets.

## Why Vector Stores Are Needed

Vector Stores are essential for applications involving embeddings due to the following reasons:

1. **Handling Embeddings**:
   - Embeddings are numerical representations of text, images, or other data capturing semantic meaning.
   - Traditional relational databases are not designed to store or query high-dimensional vectors efficiently.
   - Vector Stores provide specialized storage for vectors and metadata, enabling efficient retrieval.

2. **Semantic Search**:
   - Enable similarity searches (e.g., cosine similarity) to find vectors closest to a query vector.
   - Example: Finding movies with plots similar to a given movie by comparing their embeddings.

3. **Scalability and Performance**:
   - Support indexing techniques (e.g., clustering, approximate nearest neighbor) to perform fast searches on large datasets.
   - Example: Instead of comparing a query vector with 1 million vectors, indexing reduces comparisons to a smaller subset (e.g., 100,000).

4. **Integration with RAG**:
   - In RAG applications, Vector Stores store document embeddings, enabling retrieval of relevant documents for a given query to augment LLM responses.

## Key Features of Vector Stores

Vector Stores offer four primary features:

1. **Storage**:
   - Store vectors and associated metadata.
   - Options: In-memory (fast, temporary) or on-disk (persistent, scalable).
   - **Example**: Store movie plot embeddings with metadata like movie ID, title, or genre.
   - **Benefit**: Flexible storage for prototyping (in-memory) or production (on-disk).

2. **Similarity Search**:
   - Retrieve vectors most similar to a query vector using metrics like cosine similarity.
   - **Example**: Find the top 5 movies similar to "Spider-Man" based on plot embeddings.
   - **Benefit**: Enables semantic search for recommendation systems or RAG.

3. **Indexing**:
   - Use data structures and algorithms to enable fast similarity searches on high-dimensional vectors.
   - **Example**: Cluster 1 million vectors into 10 clusters, compute similarity with cluster centroids, and search only the most relevant cluster (e.g., 100,000 vectors).
   - **Techniques**: Clustering, Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN), Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW).
   - **Benefit**: Reduces computational complexity from O(n) to O(log n) or better, making searches faster.

4. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Support Create (add vectors), Read (retrieve vectors), Update (modify vectors/metadata), and Delete operations.
   - **Example**: Add new movie embeddings, update a movie’s plot, or delete outdated entries.
   - **Benefit**: Similar to relational database operations, enabling flexible data management.

## Vector Stores vs. Vector Databases

The terms **Vector Store** and **Vector Database** are often used interchangeably, but there are key differences:

1. **Vector Store**:
   - **Definition**: A lightweight library or service focused on storing vectors and performing similarity searches.
   - **Features**:
     - Storage of vectors and metadata.
     - Similarity search capabilities.
   - **Limitations**: Lacks advanced database features like distributed architecture, transactions, or authentication.
   - **Use Cases**: Prototyping, small-to-medium-scale applications.
   - **Example**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), a lightweight vector store.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Simple and fast.
     - Ideal for local development or small-scale projects.

2. **Vector Database**:
   - **Definition**: A full-fledged database system designed to store and query vectors with additional database-like features.
   - **Additional Features**:
     - **Distributed Architecture**: Scales to large datasets and multiple users.
     - **Durability and Persistence**: Supports backups and restores for data reliability.
     - **Metadata Handling**: Advanced querying and filtering based on metadata.
     - **ACID Transactions**: Ensures data consistency (optional in some systems).
     - **Authentication and Authorization**: Secures access to the database.
   - **Use Cases**: Production environments, large-scale applications.
   - **Examples**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - More robust and feature-rich.
     - Suitable for enterprise-level applications.

3. **Key Difference**:
   - **Vector Database = Vector Store + Database-like Features**.
   - Every Vector Database is a Vector Store, but not every Vector Store is a Vector Database.
   - **Example**: FAISS is a Vector Store (lightweight, no distributed architecture), while Pinecone is a Vector Database (scalable, with advanced features).

## Use Cases of Vector Stores

1. **Recommendation Systems**:
   - Recommend items (e.g., movies, products) based on semantic similarity of embeddings.
   - Example: Suggest movies similar to "Spider-Man" based on plot embeddings.

2. **RAG Applications**:
   - Store document embeddings for retrieval in response to user queries, augmenting LLM outputs.
   - Example: Retrieve relevant documents for a query like “What is deep learning?” to provide context to an LLM.

3. **Semantic Search**:
   - Perform searches based on meaning rather than keywords.
   - Example: Search for “movies about superheroes” to retrieve relevant movies regardless of exact keyword matches.

4. **Multimedia Search**:
   - Store and search embeddings of images, audio, or video.
   - Example: Find images visually similar to a given image.

## Vector Stores in LangChain

LangChain provides robust support for Vector Stores, integrating with popular options like Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, and Qdrant. It offers a **common interface** to ensure consistency across different Vector Stores, making it easy to switch between them without major code changes.

### Key Features in LangChain
1. **Unified Interface**:
   - Common methods like `from_documents`, `from_texts`, `add_documents`, `add_texts`, `similarity_search`, and metadata-based filtering.
   - Ensures compatibility across Vector Stores (e.g., Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone).
2. **Integration with Document Loaders and Text Splitters**:
   - Load documents using Document Loaders, split them into chunks using Text Splitters, and store their embeddings in a Vector Store.
3. **Flexibility**:
   - Switch between Vector Stores (e.g., from FAISS to Pinecone) with minimal code changes due to standardized method signatures.

### Example: Using Chroma Vector Store in LangChain

Chroma is a lightweight, open-source Vector Database ideal for local development and small-to-medium-scale production needs. It balances simplicity (like a Vector Store) and advanced features (like a Vector Database).

#### Chroma Structure
- **Tenant**: Top-level entity (e.g., user, organization, or team).
- **Database**: Multiple databases per tenant.
- **Collection**: Equivalent to a table in relational databases, storing multiple documents.
- **Document**: Contains an embedding vector and associated metadata.

#### Code Example
Below is a Python code example demonstrating how to use Chroma in LangChain to create a Vector Store, add documents, perform similarity searches, and manage data.

```python
# Install required libraries
!pip install langchain langchain_openai langchain_community chromadb

# Import libraries
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.docstore.document import Document

# Create sample documents (about cricket players)
docs = [
    Document(page_content="Virat Kohli is one of the most successful and consistent batsmen in IPL history.", metadata={"team": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}),
    Document(page_content="Rohit Sharma is known for his explosive batting and captaincy for Mumbai Indians.", metadata={"team": "Mumbai Indians"}),
    Document(page_content="MS Dhoni is a legendary wicketkeeper-batsman and captain of Chennai Super Kings.", metadata={"team": "Chennai Super Kings"}),
    Document(page_content="Jasprit Bumrah is one of the best fast bowlers in the world, playing for Mumbai Indians.", metadata={"team": "Mumbai Indians"}),
    Document(page_content="Ravindra Jadeja is a versatile all-rounder, known for his fielding and spin bowling for Chennai Super Kings.", metadata={"team": "Chennai Super Kings"}),
]

# Initialize Chroma Vector Store
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=docs,
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),  # Embedding model to convert text to vectors
    persist_directory="./my_chroma_db",  # Storage location
    collection_name="sample"  # Collection name
)

# Persist the Vector Store to disk
vectorstore.persist()

# View documents in the Vector Store
result = vectorstore.get(include=["embeddings", "documents", "metadatas"])
print("Documents:", result["documents"])
print("Metadatas:", result["metadatas"])
print("IDs:", result["ids"])

# Perform similarity search
query = "Who among these is a bowler?"
results = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=2)  # Return top 2 similar documents
for doc in results:
    print("Document:", doc.page_content, "Metadata:", doc.metadata)

# Perform similarity search with score
results_with_score = vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=2)
for doc, score in results_with_score:
    print("Document:", doc.page_content, "Score:", score)

# Filter by metadata
filtered_results = vectorstore.similarity_search("", filter={"team": "Chennai Super Kings"}, k=2)
for doc in filtered_results:
    print("Filtered Document:", doc.page_content, "Metadata:", doc.metadata)

# Update a document
new_doc = Document(
    page_content="Virat Kohli, former captain of Royal Challengers Bangalore, is known for his aggressive leadership and consistency.",
    metadata={"team": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}
)
vectorstore.update_document(document_id=result["ids"][0], document=new_doc)

# View updated documents
updated_result = vectorstore.get(include=["documents", "metadatas"])
print("Updated Documents:", updated_result["documents"])

# Delete a document
vectorstore.delete([result["ids"][0]])

# View remaining documents
final_result = vectorstore.get(include=["documents", "metadatas"])
print("Remaining Documents:", final_result["documents"])
```

#### Code Explanation
1. **Setup**:
   - Install required libraries (`langchain`, `langchain_openai`, `langchain_community`, `chromadb`).
   - Import `OpenAIEmbeddings` for generating embeddings and `Chroma` for the Vector Store.
2. **Create Documents**:
   - Create a list of `Document` objects, each with `page_content` (text about a cricket player) and `metadata` (e.g., IPL team).
3. **Initialize Vector Store**:
   - Use `Chroma.from_documents` to create a Vector Store, specifying:
     - `documents`: List of Document objects.
     - `embedding`: Embedding model (e.g., OpenAIEmbeddings).
     - `persist_directory`: Storage location for persistence.
     - `collection_name`: Name of the collection (like a table).
   - Persist the Vector Store to disk using `vectorstore.persist()`.
4. **View Documents**:
   - Use `vectorstore.get` to retrieve documents, embeddings, and metadata.
   - Each document is assigned a unique ID automatically (or you can provide custom IDs).
5. **Similarity Search**:
   - Use `vectorstore.similarity_search` to find documents similar to a query (e.g., “Who among these is a bowler?”).
   - Specify `k` to return the top `k` results.
   - Example Output: Returns documents about Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja (bowlers).
6. **Similarity Search with Score**:
   - Use `vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score` to include similarity scores (lower score = higher similarity).
7. **Metadata Filtering**:
   - Filter results by metadata (e.g., `team: "Chennai Super Kings"`) to retrieve documents for specific teams.
8. **Update Document**:
   - Use `vectorstore.update_document` to update a document’s content and metadata using its ID.
9. **Delete Document**:
   - Use `vectorstore.delete` to remove a document by its ID.
10. **Storage**:
    - Chroma stores data in a SQLite3 database format in the specified `persist_directory`.

#### Output Example
- **Documents**:
  ```python
  [
      "Virat Kohli is one of the most successful and consistent batsmen in IPL history.",
      "Rohit Sharma is known for his explosive batting and captaincy for Mumbai Indians.",
      ...
  ]
  ```
- **Metadatas**:
  ```python
  [
      {"team": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"},
      {"team": "Mumbai Indians"},
      ...
  ]
  ```
- **Similarity Search (Query: “Who among these is a bowler?”, k=2)**:
  ```python
  Document: Jasprit Bumrah is one of the best fast bowlers in the world, playing for Mumbai Indians. Metadata: {'team': 'Mumbai Indians'}
  Document: Ravindra Jadeja is a versatile all-rounder, known for his fielding and spin bowling for Chennai Super Kings. Metadata: {'team': 'Chennai Super Kings'}
  ```
- **Filtered Results (Filter: team="Chennai Super Kings")**:
  ```python
  Filtered Document: MS Dhoni is a legendary wicketkeeper-batsman and captain of Chennai Super Kings. Metadata: {'team': 'Chennai Super Kings'}
  Filtered Document: Ravindra Jadeja is a versatile all-rounder, known for his fielding and spin bowling for Chennai Super Kings. Metadata: {'team': 'Chennai Super Kings'}
  ```
