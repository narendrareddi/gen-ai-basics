# LangChain Document Loaders: Comprehensive Notes

These notes provide a detailed overview of **Document Loaders** in LangChain, a critical component for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based applications. Document Loaders enable loading data from various sources into a standardized format (Document objects) for further processing in LangChain workflows. This guide covers the concept, purpose, key types, usage, and code examples for Document Loaders, focusing on the most commonly used loaders and their applications, based on the provided transcript.

## What are Document Loaders?

Document Loaders are LangChain components designed to load data from diverse sources into a standardized format, typically as **Document objects**, which can then be used for tasks like chunking, embedding, retrieval, and generation in RAG applications.

### Key Characteristics
1. **Purpose**: Load data from various sources (e.g., text files, PDFs, web pages, CSVs) and convert it into a standardized `Document` object format.
2. **Standardized Output**: Each Document object contains:
   - **Page Content**: The actual content of the data (e.g., text from a file or webpage).
   - **Metadata**: Additional information about the data, such as source, creation date, page number, or author.
3. **Output Format**: Document Loaders always return a **list of Document objects**, even for a single file, to maintain consistency.
4. **Flexibility**: Support hundreds of data sources, with the ability to create custom loaders for unsupported sources.
5. **Loading Methods**:
   - **Load**: Eager loading, where all documents are loaded into memory at once, returning a list of Document objects.
   - **Lazy Load**: On-demand loading, returning a generator of Document objects to process one at a time, reducing memory usage.

### Why Document Loaders?
- **Problem**: RAG applications require data from diverse sources (e.g., PDFs, databases, web pages), but each source has a different format, making integration challenging.
- **Solution**: Document Loaders standardize data into Document objects, enabling seamless integration with LangChain components like text splitters, vector stores, and retrievers.

## Introduction to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Before diving into Document Loaders, it’s essential to understand their role in RAG applications:
- **What is RAG?**: RAG combines **information retrieval** (fetching relevant data from an external knowledge base) with **language generation** (using an LLM to generate accurate responses based on retrieved data).
- **Use Cases**: RAG is ideal for scenarios where LLMs lack access to specific data, such as:
  - Current affairs (e.g., recent events not in the LLM’s training data).
  - Personal data (e.g., emails, company documentation).
  - Large-scale or private documents not accessible to public LLMs like ChatGPT.
- **Benefits**:
  - Access to up-to-date or private data without uploading to external platforms.
  - Ability to process large documents by chunking them.
  - Enhanced privacy and scalability for enterprise applications.
- **Core Components**: RAG applications typically involve:
  1. **Document Loaders**: Load data from sources.
  2. **Text Splitters**: Divide documents into manageable chunks.
  3. **Vector Databases**: Store embeddings for efficient retrieval.
  4. **Retrievers**: Fetch relevant data for LLM queries.

Document Loaders are the first step in this pipeline, enabling data ingestion from various sources.

## Key Document Loaders

LangChain provides numerous Document Loaders, but this guide focuses on the four most commonly used ones: **Text Loader**, **PyPDF Loader**, **WebBase Loader**, and **CSV Loader**, along with the **Directory Loader** for bulk loading. Below are their details, including purpose, use cases, and Python syntax.

### 1. Text Loader
- **Purpose**: Loads text files into Document objects, ideal for simple text-based data.
- **Use Cases**: Processing log files, code snippets, or transcripts (e.g., YouTube video transcripts).
- **Output**: A list of Document objects, typically one per text file, with the entire file content as page content and metadata like source and encoding.
- **Syntax**:
  ```python
  from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader

  # Initialize the loader with file path and optional encoding
  loader = TextLoader(file_path="cricket.txt", encoding="utf-8")
  docs = loader.load()  # Returns a list of Document objects
  print(len(docs))  # Number of documents (usually 1 for a single file)
  print(docs[0].page_content)  # Content of the text file
  print(docs[0].metadata)  # Metadata (e.g., source: "cricket.txt")
  ```
- **Example Workflow** (Summarizing a Poem):
  ```python
  from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
  from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
  from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
  from dotenv import load_dotenv

  load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables (e.g., OpenAI API key)
  loader = TextLoader(file_path="cricket.txt", encoding="utf-8")
  docs = loader.load()
  model = ChatOpenAI()
  prompt = PromptTemplate(
      template="Write a summary for the following poem:\n{poem}",
      input_variables=["poem"]
  )
  parser = StrOutputParser()
  chain = prompt | model | parser  # Create a RunnableSequence
  summary = chain.invoke({"poem": docs[0].page_content})
  print(summary)  # Output: Summary of the poem
  ```
- **Notes**:
  - Simple and lightweight, suitable for plain text files.
  - Encoding (e.g., `utf-8`) may be required for files with special characters.

### 2. PyPDF Loader
- **Purpose**: Loads PDF files, converting each page into a separate Document object.
- **Use Cases**: Processing textual PDFs, such as reports, curricula, or books.
- **Output**: A list of Document objects, one per page, with page content and metadata (e.g., source, page number, creation date).
- **Limitations**: Works best with textual PDFs; struggles with scanned images or complex layouts (e.g., tables). Alternatives like `PDFPlumberLoader` or `UnstructuredPDFLoader` are better for such cases.
- **Dependencies**: Requires `pypdf` (`pip install pypdf`).
- **Syntax**:
  ```python
  from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

  loader = PyPDFLoader(file_path="dl_curriculum.pdf")
  docs = loader.load()  # Returns a list of Document objects (one per page)
  print(len(docs))  # Number of documents (equals number of pages)
  print(docs[0].page_content)  # Content of the first page
  print(docs[0].metadata)  # Metadata (e.g., source, page number)
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```python
  loader = PyPDFLoader(file_path="dl_curriculum.pdf")
  docs = loader.load()
  print(len(docs))  # Output: 23 (for a 23-page PDF)
  print(docs[0].page_content)  # Content of page 1
  print(docs[0].metadata)  # Metadata: {'source': 'dl_curriculum.pdf', 'page': 0, ...}
  ```
- **Notes**:
  - Each page becomes a separate Document object, making it suitable for page-level processing.
  - Metadata includes page number, source, and PDF-specific details (e.g., creator, creation date).

### 3. Directory Loader
- **Purpose**: Loads multiple files from a directory, supporting various file types (e.g., PDFs, text files) based on a specified pattern.
- **Use Cases**: Bulk loading multiple documents, such as a folder of PDFs or text files, for RAG processing.
- **Output**: A list of Document objects, with each file processed by the specified loader (e.g., PyPDFLoader for PDFs).
- **Syntax**:
  ```python
  from langchain_community.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader, PyPDFLoader

  loader = DirectoryLoader(
      path="books",  # Directory path
      glob="*.pdf",  # Pattern to match files (e.g., all PDFs)
      loader_cls=PyPDFLoader  # Loader class for processing files
  )
  docs = loader.load()  # Returns a list of Document objects
  print(len(docs))  # Total number of documents (pages across all PDFs)
  print(docs[0].page_content)  # Content of the first document
  print(docs[0].metadata)  # Metadata (e.g., source, page number)
  ```
- **Example** (Loading Multiple PDFs):
  ```python
  loader = DirectoryLoader(path="books", glob="*.pdf", loader_cls=PyPDFLoader)
  docs = loader.load()
  print(len(docs))  # Output: 1186 (e.g., 326 + 392 + 468 pages from three PDFs)
  print(docs[0].page_content)  # Content of the first page of the first PDF
  print(docs[325].page_content)  # Content of the last page of the first PDF
  ```
- **Notes**:
  - **Glob Patterns**:
    - `*.pdf`: Load all PDF files in the directory.
    - `**/*.txt`: Load all text files in the directory and subdirectories.
    - `data/*.csv`: Load all CSV files in the `data` directory.
    - `**/*`: Load all files in the directory and subdirectories.
  - Highly flexible for bulk loading, but memory-intensive for large directories.

### 4. WebBase Loader
- **Purpose**: Loads and extracts text content from web pages into Document objects.
- **Use Cases**: Processing static web pages, such as blogs, news articles, or product pages, for querying with an LLM.
- **Output**: A list of Document objects, typically one per URL, with page content and metadata (e.g., source URL).
- **Dependencies**: Uses `requests` for HTTP requests and `beautifulsoup4` for HTML parsing (`pip install requests beautifulsoup4`).
- **Limitations**: Works best with static HTML pages; struggles with JavaScript-heavy pages. Use `SeleniumURLLoader` for dynamic pages.
- **Syntax**:
  ```python
  from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader

  loader = WebBaseLoader(url="https://example.com/macbook-air")
  docs = loader.load()  # Returns a list of Document objects (one per URL)
  print(len(docs))  # Number of documents (usually 1 for a single URL)
  print(docs[0].page_content)  # Extracted text from the webpage
  print(docs[0].metadata)  # Metadata (e.g., source: URL)
  ```
- **Example Workflow** (Querying a Webpage):
  ```python
  from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
  from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
  from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

  loader = WebBaseLoader(url="https://example.com/macbook-air")
  docs = loader.load()
  model = ChatOpenAI()
  prompt = PromptTemplate(
      template="Answer the following question from the text:\n{text}\nQuestion: {question}",
      input_variables=["text", "question"]
  )
  parser = StrOutputParser()
  chain = prompt | model | parser
  answer = chain.invoke({
      "text": docs[0].page_content,
      "question": "What is the product described in the text?"
  })
  print(answer)  # Output: Apple MacBook Air M2...
  ```
- **Notes**:
  - Supports a single URL or a list of URLs (e.g., `WebBaseLoader(urls=["url1", "url2"])`).
  - Ideal for static content; for dynamic pages, consider `SeleniumURLLoader`.

### 5. CSV Loader
- **Purpose**: Loads CSV files, converting each row into a separate Document object.
- **Use Cases**: Analyzing tabular data, such as user data or sales records, with an LLM.
- **Output**: A list of Document objects, one per row, with page content as a string of column names and values, and metadata including source and row number.
- **Syntax**:
  ```python
  from langchain_community.document_loaders import CSVLoader

  loader = CSVLoader(file_path="social_network_ads.csv")
  docs = loader.load()  # Returns a list of Document objects (one per row)
  print(len(docs))  # Number of documents (equals number of rows)
  print(docs[0].page_content)  # Content of the first row
  print(docs[0].metadata)  # Metadata (e.g., source, row number)
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```python
  loader = CSVLoader(file_path="social_network_ads.csv")
  docs = loader.load()
  print(len(docs))  # Output: 400 (for a 400-row CSV)
  print(docs[0].page_content)  # Output: "User ID: 15624510\nGender: Male\nAge: 19\n..."
  print(docs[0].metadata)  # Output: {'source': 'social_network_ads.csv', 'row': 0}
  ```
- **Notes**:
  - Each row is a separate Document, making it suitable for row-level analysis.
  - Page content is formatted as a string with column names and values.

## Load vs. Lazy Load

Document Loaders support two loading methods to handle different use cases:

1. **Load (Eager Loading)**:
   - **Behavior**: Loads all documents into memory at once, returning a list of Document objects.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for small datasets or when all documents need to be processed together.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```python
     docs = loader.load()  # Returns list of Document objects
     for doc in docs:
         print(doc.metadata)  # Process all documents
     ```
   - **Drawbacks**: Memory-intensive for large datasets (e.g., thousands of documents).

2. **Lazy Load**:
   - **Behavior**: Returns a generator of Document objects, loading one document at a time into memory.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for large datasets or streaming processing to minimize memory usage.
   - **Syntax**:
     ```python
     docs = loader.lazy_load()  # Returns a generator
     for doc in docs:
         print(doc.metadata)  # Process one document at a time
     ```
   - **Example** (Directory Loader with Lazy Load):
     ```python
     loader = DirectoryLoader(path="books", glob="*.pdf", loader_cls=PyPDFLoader)
     docs = loader.lazy_load()
     for doc in docs:
         print(doc.metadata)  # Processes one document at a time
     ```
   - **Benefits**:
     - Reduces memory footprint by loading documents on-demand.
     - Faster initial response as processing starts immediately.

- **Key Difference**:
  - `load`: Loads all documents upfront, causing a delay for large datasets.
  - `lazy_load`: Processes documents one at a time, enabling consistent performance and lower memory usage.

## Custom Document Loaders

If a specific data source is not supported by existing loaders, LangChain allows creating **custom Document Loaders**:
- **Process**:
  1. Create a class inheriting from `BaseLoader`.
  2. Implement `load` and/or `lazy_load` methods to define custom loading logic.
- **Syntax**:
  ```python
  from langchain_community.document_loaders import BaseLoader

  class CustomLoader(BaseLoader):
      def __init__(self, source):
          self.source = source

      def load(self):
          # Custom logic to load data
          data = self._fetch_data()  # Example method
          return [Document(page_content=data, metadata={"source": self.source})]

      def lazy_load(self):
          # Custom logic for lazy loading
          data = self._fetch_data()
          yield Document(page_content=data, metadata={"source": self.source})

      def _fetch_data(self):
          # Implement data fetching logic (e.g., API call, custom file format)
          return "Sample data"
  ```
- **Use Case**: Loading data from proprietary formats or unsupported APIs.
- **Note**: Many existing loaders in `langchain_community` were developed by the community using this approach, contributing to LangChain’s extensive loader pool.
