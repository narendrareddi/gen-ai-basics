# LangChain Retrievers: Comprehensive Notes

These notes provide an in-depth understanding of **Retrievers** in LangChain, a critical component for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. Retrievers fetch relevant documents from a data source based on a user’s query, enabling semantic search and context-aware responses. This guide covers the definition, necessity, types, and practical implementation of Retrievers, with code examples in Python using Google Colab.

## What are Retrievers?

A **Retriever** in LangChain is a component that fetches relevant documents from a data source in response to a user’s query. It acts like a search engine, identifying and returning the most relevant documents based on semantic or keyword-based similarity.

### Key Characteristics
1. **Definition**: A Retriever takes a user query as input and returns a list of relevant `Document` objects (containing `page_content` and `metadata`) from a data source.
2. **Purpose**: Enables efficient retrieval of contextually relevant information for tasks like RAG, semantic search, or question answering.
3. **Process**:
   - Receives a user query.
   - Searches a data source (e.g., Vector Store, API, or database).
   - Returns relevant documents based on a search strategy (e.g., semantic similarity or keyword matching).
4. **Runnable Nature**: Retrievers are **Runnables** in LangChain, meaning they can be invoked using the `.invoke()` method and integrated into chains for flexible workflows.

### Why Retrievers?
Retrievers are essential for RAG-based applications, where relevant context must be retrieved from a data source to augment LLM responses. They solve the following challenges:
1. **Context Retrieval**: Fetch documents relevant to a query to provide context to LLMs.
2. **Scalability**: Efficiently search large datasets (e.g., Vector Stores) using optimized algorithms.
3. **Flexibility**: Support various data sources (e.g., Vector Stores, APIs) and search strategies (e.g., semantic search, keyword matching).
4. **Customization**: Allow advanced retrieval strategies to improve result quality and reduce redundancy.

## Recap of LangChain RAG Components
To understand Retrievers, it’s helpful to recap the core components of RAG covered in the playlist:
1. **Document Loaders**: Load documents from various sources (e.g., PDFs, websites).
2. **Text Splitters**: Split documents into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
3. **Vector Stores**: Store document embeddings for semantic search and retrieval.
4. **Retrievers**: Fetch relevant documents from a data source based on a query (focus of this guide).

With these components understood, you’re ready to study RAG applications, starting with Retrievers.

## Types of Retrievers
Retrievers in LangChain can be categorized based on two criteria:
1. **Data Source**: The type of data source the Retriever interacts with (e.g., Wikipedia, Vector Store, Arxiv).
2. **Search Strategy**: The mechanism used to identify relevant documents (e.g., similarity search, MMR, multi-query).

### 1. Data Source-Based Retrievers
These Retrievers are defined by the data source they query. Examples include:
- **Wikipedia Retriever**: Queries the Wikipedia API to fetch relevant articles.
- **Vector Store Retriever**: Searches a Vector Store for documents based on semantic similarity.
- **Arxiv Retriever**: Retrieves relevant research papers from the Arxiv website.

### 2. Search Strategy-Based Retrievers
These Retrievers differ in how they search for and rank documents. Examples include:
- **Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) Retriever**: Balances relevance and diversity to reduce redundant results.
- **Multi-Query Retriever**: Generates multiple query variations to handle ambiguous queries.
- **Contextual Compression Retriever**: Filters out irrelevant content from retrieved documents for concise results.

## Key Retrievers in LangChain
Below is a detailed explanation of the most important Retrievers, including their purpose, working mechanism, and code examples.

### 1. Wikipedia Retriever
- **Purpose**: Fetches relevant Wikipedia articles based on a user query using the Wikipedia API.
- **How It Works**:
  - Takes a user query (e.g., “Albert Einstein”).
  - Queries the Wikipedia API using keyword-based matching (not semantic search).
  - Returns the most relevant articles as LangChain `Document` objects.
- **Use Case**: Quick access to general knowledge from Wikipedia for informational queries.
- **Limitations**: Relies on keyword matching, which may miss semantic nuances.

#### Code Example
```python
# Install required libraries
!pip install langchain langchain_community

# Import Wikipedia Retriever
from langchain_community.retrievers import WikipediaRetriever

# Initialize Retriever
retriever = WikipediaRetriever(top_k_results=2, lang="en")  # Fetch top 2 results in English

# Define query
query = "Geopolitical history of India and Pakistan from the perspective of a Chinese"

# Invoke Retriever
docs = retriever.invoke(query)

# Print results
for doc in docs:
    print("Page Content:", doc.page_content[:200])  # Print first 200 characters
    print("Metadata:", doc.metadata)
```

#### Explanation
1. **Setup**: Install `langchain` and `langchain_community`. Import `WikipediaRetriever`.
2. **Initialize Retriever**: Specify `top_k_results` (number of results) and `lang` (language, default is English).
3. **Query**: Provide a query with multiple keywords (e.g., “India,” “Pakistan,” “geopolitical history”).
4. **Invoke**: Call `retriever.invoke(query)` to fetch results. Behind the scenes:
   - Queries the Wikipedia API.
   - Performs keyword-based matching.
   - Returns `Document` objects with `page_content` (article text) and `metadata` (e.g., title, URL).
5. **Output**: Prints the first 200 characters of each document’s content and its metadata.

#### Key Notes
- The Wikipedia Retriever is a **Retriever**, not a **Document Loader**, because it performs intelligent searching (keyword-based) to select relevant articles, not just loading all articles.
- Useful for quick prototyping but limited by keyword-based matching.

---

### 2. Vector Store Retriever
- **Purpose**: Fetches documents from a Vector Store based on semantic similarity using embeddings.
- **How It Works**:
  - Documents are stored as embeddings in a Vector Store (e.g., Chroma, FAISS).
  - User query is converted to an embedding using an embedding model.
  - Semantic similarity (e.g., cosine similarity) is computed between the query embedding and document embeddings.
  - Top `k` most similar documents are returned as `Document` objects.
- **Use Case**: Semantic search in RAG applications, such as retrieving relevant documents for question answering.
- **Advantages**: Leverages semantic understanding for better relevance compared to keyword-based search.

#### Code Example
```python
# Install required libraries
!pip install langchain langchain_openai langchain_community faiss-cpu

# Import libraries
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.docstore.document import Document

# Create sample documents
docs = [
    Document(page_content="LangChain is used to build LLM-based applications.", metadata={"topic": "LangChain"}),
    Document(page_content="Chroma is a vector database for storing embeddings.", metadata={"topic": "Chroma"}),
    Document(page_content="Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors.", metadata={"topic": "Embeddings"}),
]

# Initialize Vector Store
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())

# Create Retriever
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 2})  # Fetch top 2 results

# Define query
query = "What is Chroma used for?"

# Invoke Retriever
results = retriever.invoke(query)

# Print results
for doc in results:
    print("Page Content:", doc.page_content)
    print("Metadata:", doc.metadata)
```

#### Explanation
1. **Setup**: Install `langchain`, `langchain_openai`, and `faiss-cpu`. Import `FAISS`, `OpenAIEmbeddings`, and `Document`.
2. **Create Documents**: Define sample `Document` objects with `page_content` and `metadata`.
3. **Initialize Vector Store**: Use `FAISS.from_documents` to create a Vector Store, embedding documents with `OpenAIEmbeddings`.
4. **Create Retriever**: Call `vectorstore.as_retriever` with `search_kwargs={"k": 2}` to fetch the top 2 results.
5. **Query and Invoke**: Pass the query to `retriever.invoke(query)` to perform a semantic similarity search.
6. **Output**: Prints the most relevant documents (e.g., Chroma-related document first).

#### Why Use a Retriever Instead of Vector Store Directly?
- **Question**: The Vector Store has a `similarity_search` method (e.g., `vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=2)`). Why use a Retriever?
- **Answer**:
  - **Direct Similarity Search**: The Vector Store’s `similarity_search` method uses a basic similarity search strategy (e.g., cosine similarity).
  - **Retriever Benefits**:
    - Retrievers are **Runnables**, allowing integration into LangChain chains for flexible workflows.
    - Retrievers support advanced search strategies (e.g., MMR, Multi-Query) that `similarity_search` cannot handle.
    - Retrievers provide a standardized interface, making it easy to switch between strategies or data sources.

---

### 3. Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) Retriever
- **Purpose**: Balances relevance and diversity in retrieved documents to avoid redundancy.
- **Problem Addressed**: Standard similarity search may return highly similar (redundant) documents, missing diverse perspectives.
- **How It Works**:
  - Selects the most relevant document to the query.
  - For subsequent documents, chooses those that are relevant but dissimilar to previously selected documents.
  - Uses a `lambda` parameter (0 to 1) to balance relevance (lambda=1, behaves like similarity search) and diversity (lambda=0, maximizes diversity).
- **Use Case**: When you want diverse perspectives (e.g., different aspects of climate change) without redundant information.

#### Code Example
```python
# Install required libraries
!pip install langchain langchain_openai langchain_community faiss-cpu

# Import libraries
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.docstore.document import Document

# Create sample documents
docs = [
    Document(page_content="Climate change causes glaciers to melt rapidly in the Arctic.", metadata={"topic": "Climate Change"}),
    Document(page_content="Glaciers in the Arctic are melting at an alarming rate due to rising temperatures.", metadata={"topic": "Climate Change"}),
    Document(page_content="Deforestation contributes to climate change by reducing carbon absorption.", metadata={"topic": "Climate Change"}),
    Document(page_content="Wildfires are increasing due to climate change.", metadata={"topic": "Climate Change"}),
    Document(page_content="Coastal cities are at risk of flooding due to rising sea levels from climate change.", metadata={"topic": "Climate Change"}),
]

# Initialize Vector Store
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())

# Create MMR Retriever
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type="mmr", search_kwargs={"k": 3, "lambda_mult": 0.5})

# Define query
query = "What are the adverse effects of climate change?"

# Invoke Retriever
results = retriever.invoke(query)

# Print results
for doc in results:
    print("Page Content:", doc.page_content)
    print("Metadata:", doc.metadata)
```

#### Explanation
1. **Setup**: Install required libraries and import `FAISS`, `OpenAIEmbeddings`, and `Document`.
2. **Create Documents**: Define documents about climate change, including some with similar content (e.g., glacier melting).
3. **Initialize Vector Store**: Use `FAISS.from_documents` to store document embeddings.
4. **Create MMR Retriever**: Use `vectorstore.as_retriever` with `search_type="mmr"` and `lambda_mult=0.5` (balances relevance and diversity).
5. **Query and Invoke**: Pass the query to `retriever.invoke(query)` to fetch diverse, relevant documents.
6. **Output**: Returns documents covering different aspects (e.g., glaciers, deforestation, wildfires) instead of redundant glacier-related documents.

#### Key Notes
- **Problem Solved**: Avoids returning redundant documents (e.g., multiple glacier-melting documents) by prioritizing diversity.
- **Lambda Parameter**:
  - `lambda_mult=1`: Behaves like standard similarity search (high relevance, low diversity).
  - `lambda_mult=0`: Maximizes diversity (may reduce relevance).
  - Typical value: `0.5` for a balance.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for queries requiring diverse perspectives, such as summarizing broad topics.

---

### 4. Multi-Query Retriever
- **Purpose**: Handles ambiguous queries by generating multiple query variations to improve retrieval quality.
- **Problem Addressed**: Ambiguous queries (e.g., “How can I stay healthy?”) may lead to poor or irrelevant results due to unclear intent.
- **How It Works**:
  - Takes a user query and passes it to an LLM.
  - The LLM generates multiple related queries (e.g., “What foods improve health?”, “How often should I exercise?”).
  - Each query is sent to a base Retriever (e.g., similarity search Retriever).
  - Results from all queries are merged, duplicates are removed, and the top `k` results are returned.
- **Use Case**: Broad or ambiguous queries where the user’s intent is unclear.

#### Code Example
```python
# Install required libraries
!pip install langchain langchain_openai langchain_community faiss-cpu

# Import libraries
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI
from langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetriever
from langchain.docstore.document import Document

# Create sample documents
docs = [
    Document(page_content="Eating a balanced diet improves overall health.", metadata={"topic": "Health"}),
    Document(page_content="Regular exercise boosts energy levels.", metadata={"topic": "Health"}),
    Document(page_content="Managing stress is key to mental wellness.", metadata={"topic": "Health"}),
    Document(page_content="Solar systems help balance electricity demand.", metadata={"topic": "Energy"}),
    Document(page_content="Python is a versatile programming language.", metadata={"topic": "Programming"}),
]

# Initialize Vector Store
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())

# Create base Retriever
base_retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_kwargs={"k": 5})

# Create Multi-Query Retriever
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
multi_query_retriever = MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm(retriever=base_retriever, llm=llm)

# Define query
query = "How to improve energy levels and maintain balance?"

# Invoke Retrievers
similarity_results = base_retriever.invoke(query)
multi_query_results = multi_query_retriever.invoke(query)

# Print results
print("Similarity Search Results:")
for doc in similarity_results:
    print("Page Content:", doc.page_content)

print("\nMulti-Query Retriever Results:")
for doc in multi_query_results:
    print("Page Content:", doc.page_content)
```

#### Explanation
1. **Setup**: Install required libraries and import `FAISS`, `OpenAIEmbeddings`, `ChatOpenAI`, `MultiQueryRetriever`, and `Document`.
2. **Create Documents**: Define documents, some related to health and others unrelated (e.g., solar systems) to test ambiguity handling.
3. **Initialize Vector Store**: Use `FAISS.from_documents` to store document embeddings.
4. **Create Base Retriever**: Use `vectorstore.as_retriever` with `search_type="similarity"` for standard similarity search.
5. **Create Multi-Query Retriever**: Use `MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm`, specifying the LLM (`ChatOpenAI`) and base Retriever.
6. **Query and Invoke**: Pass an ambiguous query to both Retrievers to compare results.
7. **Output**:
   - **Similarity Search**: May include irrelevant results (e.g., solar systems due to “energy” and “balance” keywords).
   - **Multi-Query Retriever**: Focuses on health-related results by generating related queries (e.g., “What foods improve energy?”).

#### Key Notes
- **Problem Solved**: Resolves ambiguity by generating multiple query variations, ensuring relevant results.
- **Benefit**: Improves retrieval quality for broad or unclear queries.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for user queries with multiple possible interpretations.

### 5. Contextual Compression Retriever
- **Purpose**: Improves retrieval quality by compressing retrieved documents to keep only relevant content based on the query.
- **Problem Addressed**: Retrieved documents may contain irrelevant information, reducing user experience and increasing LLM context length.
- **How It Works**:
  - Uses a base Retriever (e.g., similarity search) to fetch documents.
  - Passes retrieved documents and the query to an LLM-based compressor.
  - The compressor trims irrelevant content, retaining only query-relevant parts.
- **Use Case**: When documents are long or contain mixed topics, or when minimizing LLM context length is critical.

#### Code Example
```python
# Install required libraries
!pip install langchain langchain_openai langchain_community faiss-cpu

# Import libraries
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI
from langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import LLMChainExtractor
from langchain.docstore.document import Document

# Create sample documents
docs = [
    Document(page_content="The Grand Canyon is a famous natural site. Photosynthesis is how plants convert light into energy. Many tourists visit every year.", metadata={"topic": "Mixed"}),
    Document(page_content="Medieval Europe had knights. Photosynthesis powers plant growth.", metadata={"topic": "Mixed"}),
    Document(page_content="Basketball is a popular sport.", metadata={"topic": "Sports"}),
]

# Initialize Vector Store
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())

# Create base Retriever
base_retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_kwargs={"k": 2})

# Create Compressor
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
compressor = LLMChainExtractor.from_llm(llm)

# Create Contextual Compression Retriever
compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(base_retriever=base_retriever, compressor=compressor)

# Define query
query = "What is photosynthesis?"

# Invoke Retriever
results = compression_retriever.invoke(query)

# Print results
for doc in results:
    print("Page Content:", doc.page_content)
```

#### Explanation
1. **Setup**: Install required libraries and import `FAISS`, `OpenAIEmbeddings`, `ChatOpenAI`, `ContextualCompressionRetriever`, `LLMChainExtractor`, and `Document`.
2. **Create Documents**: Define documents with mixed topics (e.g., Grand Canyon and photosynthesis in the same document).
3. **Initialize Vector Store**: Use `FAISS.from_documents` to store document embeddings.
4. **Create Base Retriever**: Use `vectorstore.as_retriever` for similarity search.
5. **Create Compressor**: Use `LLMChainExtractor.from_llm` with an LLM to trim irrelevant content.
6. **Create Compression Retriever**: Combine the base Retriever and compressor using `ContextualCompressionRetriever`.
7. **Query and Invoke**: Pass the query to `compression_retriever.invoke(query)` to fetch and compress documents.
8. **Output**: Returns only the photosynthesis-related sentences, ignoring irrelevant content (e.g., Grand Canyon).

#### Key Notes
- **Problem Solved**: Removes irrelevant content from retrieved documents, improving user experience and reducing LLM context length.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for long documents with mixed topics or when precise, concise results are needed.
- **Challenge**: Text splitting may create documents with mixed topics, making compression necessary.

## Other Retrievers
LangChain supports many other Retrievers, including:
- **Parent Document Retriever**: Retrieves parent documents for smaller chunks to provide broader context.
- **Time-Weighted Vector Retriever**: Prioritizes recent documents for time-sensitive queries.
- **Self-Query Retriever**: Parses queries to extract metadata filters for precise retrieval.
- **Ensemble Retriever**: Combines multiple Retrievers for improved results.
- **Multi-Vector Retriever**: Handles multiple vector representations for complex queries.

For details, refer to the LangChain documentation: [LangChain Retrievers](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/).

---

## Why So Many Retrievers?
- **Purpose**: Different Retrievers address specific problems in retrieval (e.g., redundancy, ambiguity, irrelevant content).
- **Primary Reason**: In RAG systems, basic Retrievers may yield suboptimal results. Advanced Retrievers improve performance by:
  - Enhancing relevance (e.g., Multi-Query Retriever).
  - Reducing redundancy (e.g., MMR Retriever).
  - Filtering irrelevant content (e.g., Contextual Compression Retriever).
- **Future Use**: When building advanced RAG systems, you’ll experiment with different Retrievers to optimize performance.
